<h1>Help and Site Map</h1>
<p>There are three ways to navigate this website and find the products you need.</p>
<p>Firstly, if you know which animal you want to buy for, you can click the 
picture of the animal you want on the left hand site. This will show all the 
products we have on offer that will suit that animal.</p>
<p>If you want to search more specifically than this, you can use the search box above 
(next to the magnifying glass icon). Type in a keyword relating to the type of item
you want to look at, and all products relating to this keyword will be displayed.<p>
<p>Lastly, if you want to just see out entire catalogue of fantastic products, 
you can click the "All Products" text above, you will be able to see every kind 
of product that we have for your pet.</p>
